## About
This is some extra learning I've done into how to use the spotify api

## Requirements

App.py is used to run a localhost in order to get an auth code
When running userProfile.py it will redirect to spotify account login screen
Next, **copy** the auth code and **paste into the terminal**

**.env should be setup as so**

```{python}
CLIENT_ID = "your_id"
CLIENT_SECRET = "your_secret"
```
