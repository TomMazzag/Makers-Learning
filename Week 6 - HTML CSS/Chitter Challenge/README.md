# Chitter Challenge Project 

## Project summary

* You don't have to be logged in to see the peeps.
* Users sign up to chitter with their email, password, name and a username (e.g.
  samm@makersacademy.com, password123, Sam Morgan, sjmog).
* The username and email are unique.
* Peeps (posts to chitter) have the name of the user and their user handle.
* Your README should indicate the technologies used, and give instructions on
  how to install and run the tests.
