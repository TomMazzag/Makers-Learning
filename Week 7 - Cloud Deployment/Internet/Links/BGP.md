Routing tables exist
Routing tables store where to go for future reference
It sends messages to its neighbours saying for packages coming in send them to this address 

ie route A, B, C

A - B - C

A.1 -> C.1
(A -> B -> C)
B in this case will store the address taken from A to C so in the future when a sends a request to C, B knows where to send it
