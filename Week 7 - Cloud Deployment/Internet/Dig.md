IP addresses are similar to normal large scale addresses

There are 4+ bn total ip combinations
- These ips are divided between countries and organisations

**DNS**

Domain name system is used to lookup ip addresses for domain names
When a request is made to *example.com*, [[Curl]] is used first to contact a resolver to get the ip address of *example.com*

**Resolver**

A resolver is the software responsible for converting domains into ip's
Each ISP has their own resolver and will tell the router requesting info its IP address

**TLD**

Top level domains are the end of a domain i.e `.com`
